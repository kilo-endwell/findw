# Usage

(I'd advise to add script to a folder specified in PATH to be able to it invoke easily)

(you can hardcode a directory path in the second "" arg of the "dir_to_search" variable if you don't want to specify the "-d" flag every time )

`$ findw -d <dir_to_search> -w <word_to_search_for>`

or

`$ findw -d <dir_to_search> -w "<phrase_to_search_for>"`

if you decide to hardcode the dir in "dir_to_search"

`$ findw -w <word_to_search_for>`

or

`$ findw -w "<phrase_to_search_for>"`
